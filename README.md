# retail_sales_analysis
In this mini-project, I performed a full analytics cycle independently to demonstrate my data analysis skills. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, RFM customer segmentation, A/B testing, and data visualization using Python and Power BI. The goal was to show my abilities to handle real-world datasets.
